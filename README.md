# drat repository

The bottleneck function of the TDA package is used to calculate bottleneck distances in archiDART. This step is required to compare the topology of plant root systems using persistent homology. The source tarball of the TDA package v1.6 can be downloaded from this repository.

The R package TDA was developed by Brittany T. Fasy, Jisu Kim, Fabrizio Lecci, Clement Maria, Vincent Rouvreau. The included GUDHI is authored by Clement Maria, Dionysus by Dmitriy Morozov, and PHAT by Ulrich Bauer, Michael Kerber, and Jan Reininghaus.
